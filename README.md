# dfsdocuments

- This resource relies on DFS Base. https://github.com/DarkFeather-Studios/fivem_framework
- This resource relies on an unreleased DFS network resource, but this dependency can be removed in under an hour.
- This resource is a rerelease of esx_documents. It features custom documents, as well as a feature where a document can be submitted unsigned, shown to a nearby player who then signs it and submits it, and returned to you signed and dated with their signature. This feature was not present in the original release. All otehr credits go to its original author.
- This resource requires ESX. It is unknown how long it will take to remove this dependency, but I esitmate under 3 hours.
